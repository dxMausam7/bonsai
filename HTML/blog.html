        <h1>Technology and Its impact on Daily Lives</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Christian Lous Lange once said “Technology is a useful servant but a
          dangerous slave”. Technology can be either a useful tool that advances
          civilization or a deadly weapon that contributes to the demolition of
          society. Whether it was for personal or professional reasons, everyone
          has used technology at some point in their lives. Almost every aspect
          of modern life is impacted by technology, including productivity,
          business, socialization, food and healthcare access, and
          transportation efficiency and safety. The power of the internet has
          facilitated the emergence of global communities and made it easier to
          exchange information and resources.  
          <br>
          <table><br>
            <tr>Its Positive impact </tr>
            <td>
              <li>Increased efficiency and productivity</li>
              <li>Better communication and collaboration</li>
               <li>Improved healthcare</li> 
               <li>Increased convenience</li>
                 <li>Environmental benefits</li>
            </td>
          </table>
          <br />
          <br />

          However, excessive use of some technologies has been connected to
          social division, a decline in mental health, and privacy issues. The
          purpose of this blog is to explore both bright and dark side of using
          technology. We would undoubtedly notice how much technology has
          changed our lives if we were to actually compare how we live now with
          how life was a few years ago.
        </p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <h2>In Communication</h2>
        <p>
          It has given us a great deal of freedom as well as numerous
          opportunities to save money and time. It is impossible to credit all
          of this change to a single type of technology. The level of technology
          that a country has attained can be used to gauge how much its economy
          has expanded. The one piece of modern technology that has been most
          useful in our lives is the cell phone, which is now regarded as a
          symbol of civilization. Online databases, personalized web pages,
          discussion boards, and chat rooms are all products of the great
          technological revolution.
          <br />
          <br />
          Emails, video conferencing, and other forms of instant messaging are
          just a few examples of how the information technology industry has
          completely changed human communication. People can now build mental
          bridges to shorten the distance thanks to technology. Each day that
          goes by, more people are using the internet, and this growth is
          extremely rapid. More than 700 million people from all over the world
          are actually connected by the internet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>In Education</h2>
        <p>
          Unquestionably cutting-edge, this technology has greatly improved both
          the educational standards and the way we communicate. A person can
          obtain information on any subject from anywhere at any time thanks to
          this fantastic technological advancement. It has also improved on many
          of the methods we use to meet all of our needs and expectations. It
          has given us a lot simpler and quicker solutions to pressing issues.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>E-commerce</h2>
        <p>
          You can check it out online right now if you want to buy anything. You
          don't need to go very far. We place orders and everything is delivered
          right to our door. Additionally, the availability of numerous cards
          and phone payment options has made online shopping convenient. This
          demonstrates how technology is affecting our daily lives.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>In Health Care</h2>
        <p>
          Healthcare has been transformed by digital technology. AI, machine
          learning, blockchain, mobile healthcare apps, smartwatches, and a slew
          of other technological breakthroughs have all contributed to the
          advancement of healthcare. The use of technology has increased the
          speed and output of various business activities such as marketing,
          promotions, sales, and accounting. Multiple aspects of business
          require the use of technology today, from internal operations to the
          external output of activities, from minor processes to major
          activities.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Technology was created to serve the world, but people used it so
          extensively that it caused serious problems such as health issues,
          privacy issues, and social issues. Health issues are regarded as
          critical issues that affect the user's mental and physical health.
          Furthermore, user privacy is jeopardized as a result of spying and
          data theft. Furthermore, socializing is hampered by rapid mood swings
          and a lack of social skills. People should spend less time
          communicating with one another and use technology at rates that do not
          harm people in order to avoid future problems.
